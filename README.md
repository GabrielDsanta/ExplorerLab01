Project made using some third-party libraries like iMask, I had my first experience with ViteJS and I used Vercel hosting.

I'm perfecting my JS "Vanilla" to the maximum to start in ReactJS soon, I feel I'm on the right track and I was super happy with the final project!

The project is simple, simulating a credit card payment situation in an ecommerce, dynamically updating the customer's data and also their credit card type.

Below is the Vercel link of the project
